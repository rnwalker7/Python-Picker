# Python-Picker

Created in response to 81 TRG requirement to restart NCOD; I created this simple Python script to randomly pick two names to cover shifts for NCOD. For now, the only functionality is to run the picker, I will soon add a Python module to allow the JSON to be edited, which will allow users to use the executable to change availability, as well as update the number of shifts someone has covered (which can be used as a weighted criteria for random selections when we don't get enough volunteers).
